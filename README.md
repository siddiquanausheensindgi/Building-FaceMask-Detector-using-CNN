# Building a FaceMask-Detector Using CNN

Face Mask Detection System built with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts in order to detect face masks in static images as well as in real-time video streams.Comparing the accuracy of the built model with the Transfer Learning Model.
Over the last three years, health & safety use cases have exploded due to the Covid-19 pandemic. A simple and effective way to counter the spread is the proper use of a facemask. Facemask monitoring in crowded places is not feasible manually and hence automated solutions need to be developed. Using DL techniques, we built a facemask detector that can test whether a person is wearing a mask.
Here we presents a four-class classification Mask, NoMask, Below_Nose and Below_Mouth. Using the CNN facemask detection model we got accuracy of 91%. Using the pre-trained model VGG16, accuracy obtained was 82%. The accuracy of both the models is compared and the one yielding a higher percentage of accuracy is retained. The
developed CNN model has higher accuracy than the VGG16. The model can work with still images and also work with a live video stream. By adopting this model we
can ensure that a person wears the face mask correctly thereby helping curb COVID-19 spread.
